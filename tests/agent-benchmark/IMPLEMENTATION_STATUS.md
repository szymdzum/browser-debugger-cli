# Benchmark Suite Implementation Status

## ✅ Complete Implementation

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **run-benchmark.sh** - Main test runner with summary reporting
- ✅ **lib/assertions.sh** - Assertion helpers and logging utilities
- ✅ **lib/metrics.sh** - Metrics tracking and export
- ✅ **lib/recovery.sh** - Recovery patterns, retries, and error context capture
- ✅ **results/.gitignore** - Prevents benchmark outputs from being committed

### Scenarios Implemented

#### Tier 1: Static Content (Baseline)
- ✅ **00-hn-top-stories.sh** - Extract HN frontpage stories
  - Target: https://news.ycombinator.com
  - Complexity: Tier 1 (static HTML)
  - Expected: 5-8 seconds, 100% success rate
  - Tests: Basic CDP extraction, simple selectors

#### Tier 2: Modern SPA (Real Challenge)
- ✅ **01-github-trending.sh** - Extract GitHub trending repositories
  - Target: https://github.com/trending
  - Complexity: Tier 2 (SPA with lazy loading)
  - Expected: 10-15 seconds, 95%+ success rate
  - Tests: Wait conditions, dynamic content, complex selectors

- ✅ **02-wikipedia-summary.sh** - Extract Wikipedia article summary
  - Target: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping
  - Complexity: Tier 2 (heavy DOM)
  - Expected: 8-12 seconds, 95%+ success rate
  - Tests: Heavy DOM traversal, paragraph filtering, reference handling

### Features Implemented

#### Metrics Tracking
- ✅ Per-scenario duration tracking
- ✅ Wait time measurement
- ✅ Item extraction counts
- ✅ Success/failure status
- ✅ JSON export with timestamps

#### Error Handling
- ✅ Colored logging (info, warn, error, success)
- ✅ Structured assertions with helpful messages
- ✅ Error context capture (session state, Chrome processes, ports)
- ✅ Graceful session cleanup

#### Recovery Patterns
- ✅ Retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Retry with fixed delay
- ✅ Session cleanup utilities
- ✅ Chrome process management
- ✅ Full environment reset
- ✅ Wait for condition with timeout
- ✅ Fallback wait implementation (for pre-M1)

#### Debugging Tools
- ✅ Screenshot capture mode (`--screenshot`)
- ✅ Verbose mode (`--verbose`)
- ✅ Individual scenario execution (`--scenario`)
- ✅ Error context files for failed scenarios

#### Reporting
- ✅ Real-time progress logging
- ✅ Summary report with pass/fail rates
- ✅ Individual scenario JSON results
- ✅ Aggregate benchmark summary JSON

## 📊 Current State

**Total Scenarios**: 3 (1 Tier 1, 2 Tier 2)  
**Expected Coverage**:
- ✅ Static content baseline
- ✅ SPA with dynamic loading
- ✅ Heavy DOM traversal

**Missing** (Can be added later):
- ⏳ Tier 3 scenarios (heavy JavaScript, infinite scroll)
- ⏳ Network capture scenarios (for M2)
- ⏳ Console error tracking scenarios

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Run All Benchmarks
```bash
cd tests/agent-benchmark
./run-benchmark.sh
```

### Run Specific Scenario
```bash
./run-benchmark.sh --scenario 00-hn-top-stories
```

### Debug with Screenshots
```bash
./run-benchmark.sh --scenario 01-github-trending --screenshot --verbose
```

### Compare Before/After
```bash
# Before M1
./run-benchmark.sh
cp results/benchmark-summary-*.json baseline.json

# After M1 implementation
./run-benchmark.sh
cp results/benchmark-summary-*.json improved.json

# Compare
jq -s '{
  baseline: .[0].pass_rate,
  improved: .[1].pass_rate,
  diff: (.[1].pass_rate - .[0].pass_rate)
}' baseline.json improved.json
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run baseline benchmarks** before M1 implementation:
   ```bash
   cd tests/agent-benchmark
   ./run-benchmark.sh
   ```

2. **Expected baseline results** (current state, no `dom.wait`):
   - 00-hn-top-stories: ✅ Should pass (simple, sleep-based wait)
   - 01-github-trending: ⚠️ May be flaky (sleep fallback isn't reliable)
   - 02-wikipedia-summary: ✅ Should pass (Wikipedia loads fast)

3. **After M1 (`dom.wait` implemented)**:
   - Re-run benchmarks
   - Expect 100% pass rate on Tier 1
   - Expect 95%+ pass rate on Tier 2
   - Faster execution times (no arbitrary sleeps)

4. **Add more scenarios** as needed:
   - Reddit frontpage extraction (Tier 3)
   - Product page scraping (Tier 2)
   - Form interaction (if needed)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Why This Design?

**Real Production Sites**:
- Tests against actual complexity, not mocked pages
- Validates that agents can handle real-world challenges
- Sites may change, but that's part of the test (adaptability)

**Three Tiers**:
- Tier 1: Baseline functionality (must work 100%)
- Tier 2: Real-world apps (95%+ is good)
- Tier 3: Stress tests (80%+ is acceptable)

**Recovery Patterns**:
- Retries help distinguish transient failures from bugs
- Exponential backoff prevents hammering failing services
- Error context capture helps debug failures

**No Mocking**:
- Real Chrome, real sites, real network
- If it works here, it works for agents

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Network dependency**: Tests require internet connection
2. **Site changes**: Target sites may change structure (update selectors as needed)
3. **No auth flows**: Can't test authenticated workflows without credentials
4. **Timing sensitivity**: May be flaky on slow networks (use retries)
