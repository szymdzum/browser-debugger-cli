## Implementation Priority

Based on user feedback and evaluation:

### Critical (Implement First)
1. ‚úÖ **`bdg query`** - ‚úì Already implemented!
2. ‚è≥ **`bdg status`** - Show session state
3. ‚è≥ **Live data preview** - View data without stopping

### High Priority
4. ‚è≥ **Auto-cleanup** - Handle stale sessions
5. ‚è≥ **Partial export** - Export specific data types
6. ‚è≥ **Better errors** - Helpful error messages

### Medium Priority
7. ‚è≥ **Tab management** - Better tab selection
8. ‚è≥ **Query shortcuts** - Predefined common queries
9. ‚è≥ **Annotations** - Timeline markers

### Low Priority
10. ‚è≥ **Multiple sessions** - Parallel debugging
11. ‚è≥ **Performance metrics** - Auto-capture timing
12. ‚è≥ **Streaming** - Real-time event stream

## Success Metrics

We'll measure success of improvements by tracking:

### Before Improvements
- ‚ùå Session restarts: 3-4 per debugging session
- ‚ùå Setup time: ~10 minutes (including restarts)
- ‚ùå Wasted time: ~30% of total session
- ‚ùå User confidence: Low (constant "is it working?" questions)

### After Improvements (Target)
- ‚úÖ Session restarts: 0 (auto-cleanup handles stale sessions)
- ‚úÖ Setup time: < 1 minute
- ‚úÖ Wasted time: < 5% of total session
- ‚úÖ User confidence: High (status command shows progress)
